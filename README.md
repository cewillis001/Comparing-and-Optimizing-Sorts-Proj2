Comparing-and-Optimizing-Sorts-Proj2
====================================

This repo is for hosting Project 2 for COP 4531, Data Structures, as a sample of my work.

You can read about the constraints for Project 2 in [Project 2_Sort Analysis.pdf](./Project 2_ Sort Analysis.pdf).
The short version is that it's about implementing comparison sorts and then optimizing them.

You can go straight to the my work by opening [gsort.h](./gsort.h) and searching for "implemented by CW".
My analysis of the algorithms is in [report.txt](./report.txt), [cutoffs.pdf](./cutoffs.pdf), and [random sorted input.pdf](./random sorted input.pdf).

The remaining files are various supplied test harnesses, input/output files, and the makefile.
All code not implemented by me is copyright R. C. Lacher and used with permission.
